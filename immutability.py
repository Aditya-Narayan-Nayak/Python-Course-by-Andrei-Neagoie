# immutable means it can not be change
# in python string can not be change
# for an example
selfish = "123456789"
selfish = 100
print(selfish)
# here its work but if we want to change the value of string we can not be change
selfish = "123456789"
selfish[2] = "4"
print(selfish)
# Here is the fact we get the error
